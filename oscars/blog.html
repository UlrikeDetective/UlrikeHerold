            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my capstone project for the <strong>Gen AI Intensive Course 2025Q1</strong>! 
                This project showcases how I applied what I learned throughout the 5-day course to create 
                an interactive and insightful notebook using the <strong>Gemini API</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose the <strong>Oscar Awards dataset</strong> because of my love for movies and my prior experience 
                analyzing this dataset without Gen AI. This time, I leveraged the power of Generative AI to 
                enhance my analysis and create a more interactive experience.

            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <p>
                The notebook explores the <strong>Oscar Awards dataset</strong>, which contains information about 
                winners and nominees from the inception of the awards up to 2025. Using the <strong>Gemini API</strong>, 
                I implemented:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Function calling to interact with a local SQLite database.</li>
                <li>Data analysis capabilities to extract insights from the dataset.</li>
                <li>An interactive chat interface powered by Gen AI.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This project demonstrates the capabilities of the Gemini API, including function calling, 
                retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and agent-based interactions.

            <h2>Why Movies?</h2>
            <p>
                Movies have always been a passion of mine, and the Oscar Awards dataset provides a rich 
                source of information for analysis. By combining my love for movies with the power of 
                Generative AI, I was able to create a project that is both meaningful and exciting.

            <h2>Highlights</h2>
            <p>Here are some key highlights of the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a local SQLite database from the Oscar Awards dataset.</li>
                <li>Defined functions for listing tables, describing schemas, and executing SQL queries.</li>
                <li>Implemented an interactive chat interface to answer movie-related questions.</li>
                <li>Used Gen AI to generate Python code for data visualization and analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply what I learned during the Gen AI Intensive Course. 
                By combining my passion for movies with the power of Generative AI, I was able to create a project 
                that is both fun and insightful. I hope this inspires others to explore the possibilities of Gen AI 
                in their own projects!
