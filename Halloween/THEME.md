# Frontend Challenge: Halloween Edition 🦇

## The Prompts

### CSS Art: Halloween
Create a work of art using primarily CSS! Let Halloween inspire you - jack-o-lanterns, haunted houses, creepy spiders, ghosts or anything else the season brings to mind!

Note: We're now allowing a sprinkle of JavaScript in CSS Art submissions! However, judging will continue focus primarily on the CSS component, so keep JavaScript usage light and purposeful. The star of the show should still be your CSS skills.

### Perfect Landing: Halloween
Build a polished, functional landing page with a Halloween theme.
On the landing page should be a countdown calendar counting the days until the next Halloween. Next to the day count is a ghost with a pumpkin. At the end of the page have a Halloween styled "Trick or Treat" Link. When clicking on the link it opens a new page with a cocktail animation and a random image from the folder images, along with the text "Happy Halloween".
The landing page should imagine and capture the spirit of the season and demonstrates excellent frontend fundamentals.

You may now use JavaScript or any other browser-compatible language/runtime for the Landing page. The finished product should show what modern web development can do.
